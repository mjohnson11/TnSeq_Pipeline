These are the scripts we used to measure fitness effects in the first experiment (BT / BT1) in order to choose a set of 
mutations that have fitness effects for the second experiment (TP).  This is basically a previous version of the final
s estimation pipeline, with some methodological differences, but nothing too significantly different.
Picking_Edges_Updated.ipynb briefly shows how we selected the edges using the fitness effect information.
